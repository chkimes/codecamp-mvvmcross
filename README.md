# Cross Platform Development with Xamarin and MvvmCross

This is the code used in my talk at Raleigh Code Camp. The slides are located at https://slidesource.com/p/TRVDHD8FYZXQ. 

Unfortunately, this git repo is not laid out in a logical manner for browsing - it was more meant for my use during the talk. To get to relevant points during the talk, use tags to navigate.

## Useful tags
### start
This is the initial setup with projects for all platforms and MvvmCross installed on each.

### beforefirstview
FirstViewModel created, but no bindings set up in the views.

### firstview
List view completed on all platforms (with bindings).

### beforemovieview
